#                       be the result of a %x substitution
#           -y <y>      will convert the value <y>; typically <y> will
#                       be the result of a %y substitution
#           -W (or -w)  will return the name of the combobox widget
#                       which is the parent of $w
#
# Returns:

#     result in a list of one items, the name of the combobox widget.
#     Supplying "-x 10 -y 20 -W" (in any order) will return a list of

# EXIF parser in Tcl
# Author: Darren New <dnew@san.rr.com>
# Translated directly from the Perl version
# by Chris Breeze <chris@breezesys.com>
# http://www.breezesys.com
# See the original comment block, reproduced
# at the bottom.
# Most of the inline comments about the meanings of fields
# are copied verbatim and without understanding from the
# original, unless "DNew" is there.
# Much of the structure is preserved, except in
# makerNote, where I got tired of typing as verbosely
# as the original Perl. But thanks for making it so
# readable that even someone who doesn't know Perl
# could translate it, Chris! ;-)
# PLEASE read and understand exif::fieldnames
# BEFORE making any changes here! Thanks!

# Usage of this version:
#     exif::analyze $stream ?$thumbnail?
# Stream should be an open file handle
# rewound to the start. It gets set to
# binary mode and is left at EOF or 
# possibly pointing at image data.
# You have to open and close the
# stream yourself.
# The return is a serialized array
# (a la [array get]) with informative
# english text about what was found.
# Errors in parsing or I/O or whatever
# throw errors.
#     exif::allfields
# returns a list of all possible field names.
# Added by DNew. Funky implementation.
#
# New
#     exif::analyzeFile $filename ?$thumbnail?
#
# If you find any mistakes here, feel free to correct them
# and/or send them to me. I just cribbed this - I don't even
# have a camera that puts this kind of info into the file.

# There's probably something here I'm using without knowing it.

#			Note: This is an enhanced version of procedure

#
#       Return Value:	Type of the file.  May be a list if multiple tests
#                       are positive (eg, a file could be both a directory

 # ::poWinAutoscroll::autoscroll --
 #
 #       Create a scroll bar that disappears when it is not needed, and
 #       reappears when it is.
 #
 # Parameters:
 #       w    -- Path name of the scroll bar, which should already exist
 #
 # Results:
 #       None.
 #
 # Side effects:
 #       The widget command is renamed, so that the 'set' command can
 #       be intercepted and determine whether the widget should appear.
 #       In addition, the 'Autoscroll' bind tag is added to the widget,
 #       so that the <Destroy> event can be intercepted.

 #
 # Results:

 #
 # Side effects:
 #       The widget command is renamed to its original name. The widget
 #       is mapped if it was not currently displayed. The widgets
 #       bindtags are returned to their original state. Internal memory
 #       is cleaned up.

 #
 # This procedure keeps the top-level window associated with an
 # automatic scroll bar from being resized automatically after the

#[
#	Function Name:	OPI_TransformImg
#
#	Description:	Applys a transformation matrix to an image.
#
#	Usage:		image_TRM2D (srcimg, destimg, T, oor)
#
#			srcimg:		image
#			destimg:	image
#			T:		TRM2D
#			oor:		integer, optional (IMGFILL)
#
#			Image "srcimg" is transformed geometrically according
#			to transformation matrix "T".  The result is stored in
#			image "destimg":
#			Each pixel in destimg, at position "d", is filled with
#			the color at position "s" in "srcimg", where
#
#			    s = dT.
#
#			If "s" is not within the boundaries of the source
#			image, "oor" determines what color is assigned to the
#			pixel at position "d".  Acceptable values for "oor"
#			are IMGFILL, IMGCLIP and IMGWRAP; see the description
#			of the "warp" command for an explanation.
#
#			For "img_TRM2D", the x and y coordinates in "srcimg"
#			and "destimg" increase from left to right and from bot-
#			tom to top; the lower left corners are at (0.0, 0.0);
#			the upper right corners are at (1.0, 1.0).
#
#			Note that parts of "image_TRM2D" can run concurrently
#			on multiple processors; see the desciption of the
#			"set_numproc" command.
#
#	Return Value:	None.

#	Function Name:	rotate_image
#
#	Description:	Rotate an image by an arbitray angle.
#
#	Usage:		rotate_image (srcimg, destimg, angle, xcen, ycen, oor)
#
#			srcimg:		image
#			destimg:	image
#			angle:		float
#			xcen, ycen:	float, optional (0.5, 0.5)
#			oor:		integer, optional (IMGFILL)
#
#			Image "srcimg" is rotated by counterclockwise by
#			"angle" around position (xcen, ycen).  The result
#			is stored in image "destimg".
#
#			"Oor" determines how pixels in "destimg", which are
#			not covered by the rotated version of "srcimg", are
#			treated.  Acceptable values for "oor" are IMGFILL,
#			IMGCLIP and IMGWRAP; see the description of the "warp"
#			command for an explanation.
#
#			The x and y coordinates in "srcimg" increase from
#			bottom to top; the lower left corner is at (0.0, 0.0);
#			the upper right corner is at (1.0, 1.0).
#
#			"Angle" is measured in radians.  Use the "deg_rad"
#			function to convert an angle given in degrees into
#			radians.
#
#			Note that parts of "rotate_image" can run concurrently
#			on multiple processors; see the desciption of the
#			"set_numproc" command.
