   # ~/.xinitrc is executed by xinit, which is usually invoked via startx. This program is executed after logging in: first you log in on a text console,
   # then you start the GUI with startx. The role of .xinitrc is to start the GUI part of the session, typically by setting some GUI-related settings such
   # as key bindings (with xmodmap or xkbcomp), X resources (with xrdb), etc., and to launch a session manager or a window manager (possibly as part of a
   # desktop environment).
